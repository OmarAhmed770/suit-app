## Contributing to suit-store

We're excited that you're interested in contributing to the `suit-store` project! Here's how you can get started:

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, you'll need to clone the repository to your local machine. You can do this using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MohanedElDeebGitHub/suit-store.git
```

This will create a local copy of the project on your computer.

### 2. Make Your Code Changes

Navigate into the cloned repository directory:

```bash
cd suit-store
```

Now, you can open the project in your favorite code editor and make your desired changes.

### 3. Add Changed Files

Once you've made your changes and are happy with them, you need to stage them for a commit. You can add all changed files using the following command:

```bash
git add .
```

If you only want to add specific files, you can list them individually:

```bash
git add path/to/your/file1.js path/to/your/file2.css
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

After staging your files, commit them with a descriptive message. A good commit message explains *why* you made the changes, not just *what* changed.

```bash
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message here"
```

For example:

```bash
git commit -m "Feat: Implement user authentication feature"
```
or
```bash
git commit -m "Fix: Resolve issue with shopping cart total calculation"
```

### Next Steps

After committing your changes, you'll typically push them to a branch on GitHub and then open a Pull Request to merge your changes into the main project.
